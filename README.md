Ibrahim Gillani — Cybersecurity Portfolio

This repository hosts my personal cybersecurity portfolio website, built to document hands-on learning, practical projects, and proof of work rather than theory or buzzwords.

The site is designed with a terminal-inspired interface to reflect a systems-first mindset and a focus on real operational skills.

🌐 Live site: https://ibrahimgillani.github.io

Focus Areas

Linux administration and internals

Networking fundamentals and traffic analysis

Blue team and SOC concepts

Detection thinking, logs, and triage

Practical labs and small security projects

The emphasis is on how things work, what breaks, and how issues are identified and fixed.

What This Site Contains
Home

A terminal-style introduction that clearly states identity, role, and technical focus.

Projects

Small, focused projects that demonstrate:

the problem being solved

tools and commands used

mistakes encountered

lessons learned

Each project is intended to show thinking and execution, not just outcomes.

Labs

Repeatable labs covering Linux, networking, and blue team fundamentals.
Labs are structured so they can be reproduced and understood step by step.

Notes

Concise technical notes explaining concepts in clear language, often tied to real commands or observations.

Contact

Direct contact information, including a PGP public key for secure communication.

PGP Public Key

For secure or encrypted communication, my PGP public key is available on the site.

Key file: pgp-key.asc

Use case: encrypted email and identity verification

Technology & Hosting

Built as a static site

Developed using Replit

Deployed on GitHub Pages

No backend or tracking scripts

No client-side analytics

This keeps the site fast, transparent, and easy to audit.

Design Philosophy

Signal over aesthetics

Proof of work over claims

Clarity over complexity

Terminal realism over marketing UI

Everything on the site is intentional and minimal.
